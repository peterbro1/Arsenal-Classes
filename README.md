Arsenal Classes-

Adds 5 MMORPG classes inspired by DnD to the game that players get to choose from.

- Each class gets a unique indefinite potion effect.
- Prefixes that work with all chat plugins
- Prefixes age over time and look better as the player spends more time on the server.
- Prefix advancement maxes at 14 days total play time.


There is no documentation or support as this was a privately contracted project never meant to be shared publicly. This is now abandoned, and I do not plan to maintain it.
